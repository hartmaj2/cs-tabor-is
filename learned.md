# Things I learned

## Git
- `git fetch` downloads changes that should be made to working dir but doesn't integrate them
- `git pull` integrates the changes right away, `git pull = git fetch + git merge`

## Blazor
- To mark parameters for components as required when creating a component using the html tag use `[Parameter, EditorRequired]` and set it as required
